# Question: If I lose my secret phrase / passphrase, how can I recover my account?

Unfortunately, if you've lost this information you cannot recover the account. We recommend:

1. Writing / printing your secret phrase / passphrase on a piece of paper and retaining it physically.
2. Using a password manager to store this information, some popular ones include LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane, and Bitwarden.
3. You may also want to consider purchase a hardware wallet for advanced security.
